I'm a **software engineer** -- I care about designing and delivering
**full stack** solutions that make peoples' lives better.
I'm knowledgeable in **web development** technologies including html/css/js,
React, Vue, and CMSes, as well as **backend frameworks** such as
Python/Flask, node.js/express, Go, Java, and OpenAPI.

I'm passionate about music performance. I play **percussion** or **trombone**
with local community bands and orchestras,
including the [Ann Arbor Concert Band](https://www.aaband.org),
[Detroit Community Ensembles](https://www.dso.org/community-and-learning/wu-family-academy/civic-youth-ensembles/detroit-community-ensembles),
and more. I also play **drum set**.

I love board games like [Wingspan](https://www.elizhargrave.com/games/wingspan)
