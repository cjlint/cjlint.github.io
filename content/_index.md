I'm a **software engineer** -- I care about designing and delivering
**full stack** solutions that make peoples' lives better.
Currently I'm expanding my **web development** skills beyond plain html/css/js
by studying CMSes like Wordpress and Hugo.

I'm passionate about music performance. I play **percussion** or **trombone**
with my local community bands and orchestras in the Detroit Metro area,
including the [Ann Arbor Concert Band](https://www.aaband.org),
[Detroit Community Ensembles](https://www.dso.org/community-and-learning/wu-family-academy/civic-youth-ensembles/detroit-community-ensembles),
and more. I play **drums** in a casual jazz group.

I love [Wingspan](https://www.elizhargrave.com/games/wingspan), I've been playing
it for more than a year with anyone who will let me explain the rules.
