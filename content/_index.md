I'm a **software engineer** -- my goal is to only design things
that matter to people

## Things I'm doing

- I work with [Project N95](https://projectn95.org), a non-profit marketplace for masks,
  to improve their E-commerce Jamstack implementation in areas such as website performance,
  conversion rates, and CMS workflow

- I work at [Menlo Innovations](https://menloinnovations.com) where I have the
  opportunity to work with a wide variety of custom software clients, in a
  transparent and effective working style

- I volunteer with local organizations to help keep their websites running.
  I've reduced costs associated with running websites all the way down to **$0** by
  advising organizations to host their content sites on major cloud providers, such as
  Firebase/GCP. Reach out if this idea interests you!

- I contribute to https://wingspangoals.com, a tool that makes it easier to play
  my favorite board game

- I blog about weird things I learn while developing. Mostly so I don't forget them ðŸ™‚
  and hopefully to aid the wayward Google searcher.

I'm also passionate about music performance. I play **trombone** or **percussion**
with local community bands and orchestras.
