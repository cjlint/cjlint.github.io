I'm a **software engineer** -- I care about designing and delivering
solutions that make peoples' lives better.

I work with [Project N95](https://projectn95.org) as a full stack developer,
working on website performance and e-commerce data flows.

I contribute to https://wingspangoals.com, a tool that makes it easier to play
my favorite board game

I'm passionate about music performance. I play **percussion** or **trombone**
with local community bands and orchestras. I also play **drum set**.
